Lesson 1. Introducing yourself/ others

Most people attend a conference/ have business meeting at some point in their careers and this
is an opportunity to meet new people. What people say and do when they first meet someone
at work is extremely important. An introduction is a polite method of starting a conversation,
a way to establish a connection between yourself and someone who you do not know, or
between people you know but they do not know each other.

Introductions are important because they help people feel comfortable around each other, can
help them start a conversation with someone they have not met before. Thus, they can expand
their professional network and also create a positive first impression.
